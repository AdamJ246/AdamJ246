- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @AdamJ246
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning about the foundations of hardware-level code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying to become a Computer Engineer at the college of Mercer University in GA.

  I have programming experience in:
  - C++/C: Advanced College Level Experience   (Preferred Language)
  - Java: Intermediate College Level Experience
  - C Assembly: Novice Experience
  - Javascript: Novice Experience
  - CSS: Novice Experience
  - Python: Novice Experience
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Primarily by email using ajohnston2244@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun facts: Digitally, I enjoy partaking in video games and Art. Physically, I enjoy weight training and Martial Arts. 
  - I love to learn anything that I may use to create new things. For example, I hope to use
    my programming knowledge to aid in the creation and augmentation of real machines; this includes any form of purely digital
    system (like a server) and extends to machines like a car.
- Overall, in this age of computer scientists, I seek to build the foundation for their work.
